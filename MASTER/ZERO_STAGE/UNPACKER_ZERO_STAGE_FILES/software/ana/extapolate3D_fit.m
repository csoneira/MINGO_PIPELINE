function [X, Y, Z] = extapolate3D_fit(points,Z0)

% points  are athe 3d point in the form X_,Y_,Z_ as many as I want X_ = points(:,1), Y_ = points(:,2), Z_ = points(:,3)
% Z0 is the coordiante in the Z_
%
%

N = size(points,1);


X_ave=mean(points,1);            % mean; line of best fit will pass through this point  
dX=bsxfun(@minus,points,X_ave);  % residuals
C=(dX'*dX)/(N-1);           % variance-covariance matrix of X
[R,D]=svd(C,0);             % singular value decomposition of C; C=R*D*R'
% NOTES:
% 1) Direction of best fit line corresponds to R(:,1)
% 2) R(:,1) is the direction of maximum variances of dX 
% 3) D(1,1) is the variance of dX after projection on R(:,1)
% 4) Parametric equation of best fit line: L(t)=X_ave+t*R(:,1)', where t is a real number
% 5) Total variance of X = trace(D)
% Coefficient of determineation; R^2 = (explained variance)/(total variance)
% Parametric equation of best fit line: L(t)=X_ave+t*R(:,1)', where t is a real number
% x = x0 + t*a; y = y0 + t*b; z = z0 + t*c; R(:,1) = (a, b, c); X_ave =(x0, y0, c0);

t = (Z0 - X_ave(3))/R(3,1);
